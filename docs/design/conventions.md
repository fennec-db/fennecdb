# Conventions

The long form of the test and docs conventions [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) lists under *Conventions*: where tests live and which run alone, a test that fails on one run, Chrome's launch, the clock, ports, and what a change a user meets owes the docs. They hold no invariant of the code, so [README.md](README.md#the-original-order) does not number them. Each section below is a bullet moved word for word from CLAUDE.md, which keeps its rule in a sentence or two.

## Test binaries

Unit tests live inline in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`; cross-crate and
protocol tests in `crates/*/tests/`, a file each, gathered into one binary
a crate by `tests/all.rs` (`autotests = false`: a new file needs its `mod`
line there, or it is never built). A test reading the process's own
counts, `/_metrics` or the statements', is a `[[test]]` of its own; so is
one whose servers hold many threads (past macOS's 2 048 a process, a
server answers 503 to whichever test asked), and so are `fennec-http`'s
`tests/audit.rs` and `fennec-shard`'s `tests/refusals.rs`: the wait after a
refusal is the process's, so the other tests' servers ask with none
(`audit::set_delay(0)` in their helpers). Measurement programs are each
crate's `examples/` and `fennec-bench`'s binaries, wired to `make` targets,
not to CI.

## Reruns

A test that fails and passes on a rerun is a bug, the test's or the
code's: reproduce it -- in a loop, under load (`docker run --cpus=3`
beside busy loops is GitHub's three-core runner) -- and fix it, never
retry it away or lengthen a sleep. A test waits for an event, not for a
time: it holds what it races (`Replica.setOnline(false)` before a write it
reads back, a call held under way across a burst, a disk's fsync held at a
gate) and bounds only the wait for something that must happen. A CI log
names every failing test with its assertion (cargo's and `swift test`'s
own output, Gradle's `testLogging`, `dart test`'s GitHub reporter, `node
--test --test-reporter=spec`); a failing mobile job uploads
`test-reports-android` or `test-results-apple` (the simulator's
`.xcresult`).

`make stress-test` is that reproduction as a target (`tools/stress-test.sh`):
the Rust suites (`cargo test --workspace`, or one crate with `CRATE=`) and
the JS tests (`node --test web/*.test.js`) `ITER=` times (20), inside
`docker run --cpus=3` beside three busy loops. Everything runs in the
container, load included: many loopback clients on the host once exhausted
its ports and cut every agent off the API. The script starts every busy loop
and kills it by PID on every way out (exit, Ctrl-C, a failure), and kills
its container by name if interrupted. The cargo home, the target directory
and a copy of the sources (made by content, as `tools/image-cargo.sh` does,
so an older checkout is not taken for built) live in the Docker volume
`fennec-stress-cache`, so the iterations rebuild nothing; `docker volume rm
fennec-stress-cache` clears it. It stops at the first failure, keeps that
iteration's log (the directory is printed) and names the iteration and the
failing tests; a passing iteration's log is dropped. `TIMEOUT=` (seconds,
14400) bounds the whole run. It is a measurement run by hand or on a quiet
night, not a CI job; a test it fails is fixed in the test or the code,
never retried.

`tools/ci_flakes.py -n 50` is the ledger: the failed jobs of the last 50
completed `ci.yml` runs on main and in the merge queue, each with its failing
step and whether a later commit fixed it (a pull request that passed again
with changed files, a later push touching the same files). A failure that
passed again with the same files is a flake and counts, whatever its cause.
The 1.0 plan's budget is none without a fixing commit.

Which `ci.yml` jobs are required checks is a repository setting (classic
branch protection on main, not the merge queue's ruleset). All of them are,
but `size (browser module)`, which only runs on a pull request and so would
never report in the merge queue. A job given a path filter or an `if:` that
skips it on some events cannot be required for the same reason: a skipped
required check blocks a merge it should not. A new job that is neither
needs adding to the list.

The mobile jobs upload build products nothing downloads
(`fennecdb-android`, `fennecdb-xcframework`) with `continue-on-error`: an
upload that fails on GitHub's side does not fail a job whose tests passed
(#590 and #591 lost merge-queue runs to one). The test-report uploads run
only when a step failed, and no step retries a test.

## Chrome

A step that launches Chrome reads Chrome's own files first, or a cold
runner's disk spends 5 to 20 s of the launcher's wait (`waiting for
dynamic debugging port`): the studio's harness (`warm`) and
`examples/{shop,analytics}/scripts/warm-chrome.mjs` do; a longer wait only
moves the bound.

A `waitForFunction` predicate returns `null` for what is not on the page
yet and never throws. Puppeteer starts the page's poller with `void
poller.start()`, so a throw -- `document.querySelector('.ed')` is `null`
until the query editor, a module fetched by its first use, is mounted --
is a `pageerror` and not a failed wait: the polling ends and the wait runs
out its timeout with nothing said of why. That was the studio's `cell`
after a call form's submit: the test's own call answered before the editor
had mounted, 5 runs in 100 on one core (`docker run --cpus=1`) and none in
84 with the root checked.

## The clock

A test reads the clock from below. A sleep never ends early, so `took >=
wait` holds on any machine, while a bound from above measures it: macOS
gives a QoS-clamped job's timers hundreds of milliseconds of leeway
(`taskpolicy -c background` tries it). Where the time is the property -- a
held request answered before its wait, a node that stops once its lease is
out -- the bound is what it stands against, with seconds to spare: half
the wait, the lease the node reports it has left. Elsewhere the test
asserts the event, the count or the order: the wait a refusal would take
(`audit::would_wait`), a grant queued behind another
(`Router::grants_waiting`), the grants a node took while another hangs
(`Router::round_grants`). A timeout a test gives its servers or clients
bounds every request they make, not just the one it is about (a router's
upstream timeout of 600 ms failed a tenant's create at background QoS).

## Ports

A server a test or a harness starts listens on port 0 (`--http
127.0.0.1:0`, `--listen 127.0.0.1:0`, Node's `listen(0)`) and is found by
the `listening on: http://<address>` line on stderr of fennec-server and
fennec-shard (their usage names it, `fennec-shard`'s `tests/listen.rs` holds
it): a fixed port, or one found free and handed over, met another suite's
server. A router is told its nodes by the addresses they said. A test
stops a server as a supervisor does, with `SIGTERM`, on Windows with
Ctrl+Break to its process group -- the harness starts each in a group of
its own (`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`), on the console it shares with them
-- and kills one with `SIGKILL`, on Windows `TerminateProcess`
(fennec-server's `support::Server::signal`). Only a site
whose address is needed before it binds -- a Next.js build renders it, the
database's CORS names it -- takes a port the system picks, held by a
stand-in listener until the moment it starts (`examples/shop`,
`examples/dispatch`'s `ci.sh`).

An address a test means nothing to listen on is `127.0.0.1:1`, which no
system hands out, never a port picked and let go of: Linux hands a free
port out at random, and a listener of a test running beside it took it. A
router meant to find its node refused forwarded to another test's router
(`fennec-shard`'s `cors.rs`, once in 50 runs), and a relay meant for a
region whose routers refuse it was answered by one naming its own node
(`unsent.rs`, once in 300 runs of `unsent::`; none in 600 on port 1), each
in Docker's Linux, three cores beside six busy loops. In Docker's Linux a
port let go of came back from a `bind` to port 0 17 times in 100 000, and
none while a connection its listener accepted was open or closing, so a
stand-in node closed after it answered keeps its port while the test holds
that connection or has just closed it.

## Docs a change owes

A change that adds or alters something a user meets says so where a user
looks, in the same pull request: its reference page under
`site/content/docs/`; README's feature table and the links beside it; the
home page (`site/content/index.html`) and the docs index when a visitor
would pick fennecdb for the feature; and the SDK lists (`languages.html`,
`mobile.html`, `sharding-read-replicas.html`'s SDK paragraph, `integrations.html`'s)
when an SDK changes. A section added or changed is found by its words
alone until the site's search vector cache has its vector: after sections
change, commit the next `site` deploy's `search-embeddings` artifact as
`site/search-embeddings.json` (`gh run download <run> -n
search-embeddings`) where it differs.
